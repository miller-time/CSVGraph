Graph your CSV data and save it as a PNG!

To install:
    python setup.py [options]

To use:
    csvgraph [filename]

-------------------------------------------------------------

CSVGraph assumes that your first column of data is the X axis,
each additional column is its own line on the Y axis.

The first row is considered labels, and will be used to build
a legend, any strings elsewhere in the file will be ignored.

The X axis is labeled by the first cell of the first column.
